# Pace Go API

This directory contains the incremental Gin, GORM, and PostgreSQL replacement for the Django API. Business modules are migrated in separate pull requests; Django remains the behavioral reference until a module passes its contract and integration tests.

## Run locally

Set `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, and `REDIS_URL` to the same values used by the Django deployment, then run:

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

The server listens on `:8000` by default. Override it with `PACE_API_ADDRESS`.

Authentication publishes the existing Django Celery email tasks through RabbitMQ. Configure `AMQP_URL`, or the same `RABBITMQ_HOST`, `RABBITMQ_PORT`, `RABBITMQ_USER`, `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`, and `RABBITMQ_VHOST` values used by Django. OAuth, SMTP, signup, and sync flags continue to come from `instance_configurations` when `SKIP_ENV_VAR=1`; encrypted values use the existing Django Fernet format and `SECRET_KEY`.

## Verify

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
go test -race -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
```

To verify GORM writes against a disposable PostgreSQL database that already has
the Django schema, run the rollback-only integration test:

```bash
AUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... go test -count=1 ./internal/auth -run TestGORMRepositoryAgainstDjangoSchema
```

The user/profile/account module uses the same rollback-only shared-schema
verification:

```bash
USER_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... go test -count=1 ./internal/user -run TestUserModelsAgainstDjangoSchema
```

The core Workspace schema test uses the same rollback-only approach:

```bash
WORKSPACE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... go test -count=1 ./internal/workspace -run TestWorkspaceModelsAgainstDjangoSchema
```

The core Project schema test follows the same pattern:

```bash
PROJECT_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://... go test -count=1 ./internal/project -run TestProjectModelsAgainstDjangoSchema
```

Health endpoints are `/api/health`, `/api/health/db`, and `/ready`.

## Migrated module: authentication

The `/auth/` module preserves all 37 Django routes for app and Space authentication:

- credential and magic-code sign-in/sign-up;
- Google, GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea OAuth initiation/callbacks;
- email checks, sign-out, forgot/reset/change/set password, and CSRF tokens;
- shared rate limiting, accepted-invitation processing, and existing Celery email side effects.

Sessions are stored in the existing `sessions` table and encoded with Django's signing format. Passwords, password-reset tokens, CSRF masks, cookies, error codes, and redirects remain compatible during gradual traffic cutover. The Go service does not run schema migrations; Django migrations remain authoritative until the database module is migrated.

## Migrated module: user/profile/account

Core `/api/users/me/` profile, session, settings, profile, OAuth accounts, email
verification, instance-admin, onboarding, deactivation, and `/api/v1/users/me/`
routes are implemented in `internal/user`; the proxy cuts over only these paths
while workspace activity and other API modules remain on Django.

## Migrated module: core workspace

Core workspace CRUD, membership, member preferences, and invitation routes are
implemented in `internal/workspace`. They preserve Django session authentication,
role checks, soft-delete behavior, cache invalidation, Celery workspace seed and
invitation tasks, and the existing PostgreSQL tables. Shared-schema integration
tests run against the authoritative Django migrations, and the proxy sends only
the migrated core routes to Go. Workspace metadata, preferences, favorites,
drafts, activity, and dashboard routes remain on Django for later module-specific
pull requests.

## Migrated module: workspace themes

Workspace Theme list, create, retrieve, partial-update, and soft-delete routes
are implemented separately from the core Workspace module. The module retains
Django's admin/member permission boundary, JSON response shape, audit fields,
name uniqueness, and related-object soft-delete task behavior.

## Migrated module: workspace user properties

The workspace user properties GET and PATCH routes are implemented for the
current user's filters, display settings, rich filters, and navigation settings.

## Migrated module: workspace user preferences

The workspace sidebar preference GET and PATCH routes are implemented with the
seven Django preference keys, default ordering, and pinned-item behavior. Like
Django, seeding goes through a bulk insert that leaves `created_by` null, and
the PATCH route writes only `is_pinned` and `sort_order`.

## Migrated module: workspace home preferences

The workspace home preference GET and PATCH routes seed the `quick_links`,
`recents`, and `my_stickies` widgets with Django's descending sort order,
return the stored `config` on the list route only, and reject writes from
non-members with the `allow_permission` error body.

## Shared: editor HTML sanitization

`internal/htmlsanitizer` ports `plane.utils.content_validator.validate_html_content`,
which Django runs over stored editor HTML with nh3, the Python binding for the
Rust ammonia crate. ammonia parses with html5ever, filters the tree, and
serializes it again, so its output carries HTML5 tree construction: unclosed
elements get closed, a bare table gains its `tbody`, and misnested inline
elements are repaired. The port therefore parses with `golang.org/x/net/html`,
which implements the same algorithm, rather than filtering tokens.

Expectations in `sanitizer_test.go` are the output of nh3 0.2.18, the version
pinned in `apps/api/requirements/base.txt`. Output matches nh3 on the editor
markup this policy is meant for; `<svg>` and `<math>` subtrees can serialize
differently because html5ever and `x/net/html` build foreign content
differently. Those elements are in no allowlist and are unwrapped either way,
and `TestCleanNeverEscapesThePolicy` reparses generated markup to assert that
nothing outside the allowlisted tags, attributes, and URL schemes ever survives.

## Migrated module: workspace quick links

The workspace quick link list, create, retrieve, partial-update, and delete
routes are scoped to the requesting user's own links. They keep Django's
scheme-prefixing of bare URLs, its `URLValidator` rules, the project-derived
workspace resolution in `WorkspaceBaseModel.save`, the soft delete and its
related-object task, and the two different not-found bodies the retrieve and
partial-update routes return. `validURL` is a port of Django 5.2's
`URLValidator` and is verified against its output.

## Migrated module: core project

Core Project list, retrieve, create, partial-update, and delete routes are
implemented in `internal/project`. They keep Django's two different list
shapes, the annotated queryset behind `ProjectListSerializer`, the guest and
member visibility narrowing, and the create side effects: the project
identifier row, the acting user and the project lead as project admins, each
admin's `ProjectUserProperty` ordered ahead of their existing projects, and the
six default states inserted the way `bulk_create` does, leaving the slug empty.
`description_html` goes through `internal/htmlsanitizer` the way
`ProjectSerializer.validate` runs it through nh3.

Updating re-derives `intake_view` from the `inbox_view` alias, refuses archived
projects, and creates the default Intake when the view is switched on. Deleting
soft-deletes the project with its deploy boards and favorites and queues the
same Celery tasks. The Celery publisher gained keyword-argument support here,
because `model_activity`, `webhook_activity`, and `recent_visited_task` are all
called with keywords.

`projects/details/`, `project-identifiers/`, project members, invitations,
archiving, favorites, and deploy boards remain on Django.

## Migrated module: project members

Project member list, add, retrieve, partial-update, remove, and leave routes are
implemented in `internal/project`, together with `project-members/me/`,
`project-views/`, the per-member preference routes, and
`users/me/workspaces/<slug>/project-roles/`.

They keep Django's `allow_permission` project level, which accepts one of the
listed project roles or an active membership plus the workspace admin role, and
the layered checks on role changes and member deactivation. Adding members
reactivates and re-roles existing rows, rejects roles that do not fit the
target's workspace role, seeds each new member's `ProjectUserProperty` ahead of
their existing projects, and queues the same invitation email.

`ProjectMemberRoleSerializer` returns every declared field: the views pass a
`fields` argument, but `DynamicBaseSerializer` overwrites it with `expand`, so
nothing is filtered. Retrieve returns the admin shape only when the caller's
project role is above guest.

## Migrated service: Celery worker, email tasks

`cmd/worker` runs the Go half of the Celery workload. It is a protocol v2
consumer that reads only the queue named by `PACE_WORKER_QUEUE`, so the Python
worker keeps consuming the shared `celery` queue and the two never compete for a
task only one of them can run. The API routes exactly the task names
`worker.MigratedTaskNames()` reports to that queue; leaving `PACE_WORKER_QUEUE`
unset routes everything back to Python, which is the rollback switch.

The eight email tasks are implemented: magic sign-in, forgot password, user
activation and deactivation, the email update code and its confirmation, the
workspace invitation, and the project addition notice. Each renders the same
template Django renders, derives the plain text part with Django's `strip_tags`
rules, which leave entities escaped, and sends a multipart message using the
SMTP settings from `instance_configurations` with the environment as fallback.
The workspace invitation still writes the plain text back onto the invite row
before sending, as Django does.

A task name that reaches the Go queue without a handler is rejected without
requeueing and logged, so a routing mistake surfaces instead of silently
dropping work.

```bash
PACE_WORKER_QUEUE=pace-go go run ./cmd/worker
```
